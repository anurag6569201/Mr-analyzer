      "Text:Malaria, a mosquito-borne parasitic infection, remains a formidable public health threat, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions. Caused by Plasmodium parasites, malaria is transmitted through the bite of infected female Anopheles mosquitoes. Symptoms typically manifest within 10-15 days after a bite and may include fever, chills, sweating, headache, muscle pain, nausea, and vomiting. In severe cases, malaria can lead to life-threatening complications such as cerebral malaria, respiratory distress, and organ failure. Diagnosis involves microscopy or rapid diagnostic tests to detect the parasites in the blood. Treatment options include artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs), which have significantly reduced malaria-related mortality. Preventive measures include the use of insecticide-treated mosquito nets, insect repellents, and antimalarial prophylaxis for travelers visiting endemic areas. Ongoing research focuses on developing more effective vaccines, diagnostic tools, and treatments to combat malaria and its devastating impact on global health.\n",

       "'Malaria, a mosquito-borne parasitic infection, remains a formidable public health threat, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions. Caused by Plasmodium parasites, malaria is transmitted through the bite of infected female Anopheles mosquitoes. Symptoms typically manifest within 10-15 days after a bite and may include fever, chills, sweating, headache, muscle pain, nausea, and vomiting. In severe cases, malaria can lead to life-threatening complications such as cerebral malaria, respiratory distress, and organ failure. Diagnosis involves microscopy or rapid diagnostic tests to detect the parasites in the blood. Treatment options include artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs), which have significantly reduced malaria-related mortality. Preventive measures include the use of insecticide-treated mosquito nets, insect repellents, and antimalarial prophylaxis for travelers visiting endemic areas. Ongoing research focuses on developing more effective vaccines, diagnostic tools, and treatments to combat malaria and its devastating impact on global health.'"
