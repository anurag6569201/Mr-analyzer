5,Jaundice,good,Jaundice is a medical condition characterized by the yellowing of the skin and the whites of the eyes caused by an excess of bilirubin in the bloodstream. This yellow pigment is produced during the normal breakdown of red blood cells and is usually processed by the liver. However jaundice can occur when there is an issue with the liver such as hepatitis cirrhosis or liver cancer that prevents it from properly filtering bilirubin. It can also be caused by conditions that increase the rate of red blood cell breakdown such as hemolytic anemia. Symptoms of jaundice include yellowing of the skin and eyes dark urine pale stools and itching. Treatment for jaundice involves addressing the underlying cause whether it be an infection a genetic condition or a blockage in the bile ducts. Early diagnosis and treatment are crucial for preventing potential complications and ensuring effective management of the condition.
